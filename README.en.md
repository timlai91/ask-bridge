# Ask Bridge 🦀

`ask-bridge` is a powerful, lightweight command-line tool written in **Rust** that automates ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or the experimental Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat directly in your real Chrome browser. It uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)** via the embedded `doggy8088/mcp-cli` Rust library dependency and `chrome-devtools-mcp` to control Chrome, input prompts, click submit, and print the response back to your terminal. ChatGPT is the default when no global provider is configured; use `--provider gemini`, `--provider claude`, `--provider m365`, or the global config file to switch providers.

## Design Intent

The core purpose of `ask-bridge` is not to replace ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or any Coding Agent. It is to bridge them together. During software development, many AI-assisted tasks are exploratory: researching background information, summarizing documents, comparing options, digesting error messages, analyzing code snippets, drafting text, or clarifying uncertain technical questions. These tasks do not always need to be handled directly by the primary Coding Agent, and they do not always justify using the same agent budget that should be reserved for code editing, testing, refactoring, and integration work.

With `ask-bridge`, a Coding Agent can delegate low-risk, exploratory, and research-oriented tasks to the ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude websites, then bring the website response back into the terminal or the next step of the local workflow. Because ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude website usage quotas are typically separate from Coding Agent execution quotas, `ask-bridge` gives developers a more flexible way to allocate AI resources: the primary agent can focus on understanding the repository, modifying code, running tests, and integrating results, while website-based AI handles background research, text processing, and candidate solution generation.

In other words, `ask-bridge` is an external research bridge for AI Agents. It turns the manual workflow of switching to a browser, pasting a prompt, waiting for a response, and copying the result back into a command-line-driven automation capability. This lets an agent request help from ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude without leaving the local development workflow, then use the response as supporting context for its own judgment.

This tool is especially useful for:

- Sending large documents, error messages, or code snippets to a website-based AI for summarization, comparison, or first-pass analysis.
- Letting a Coding Agent outsource background research, alternative analysis, or checklist generation before implementation.
- Moving AI tasks that do not directly modify project files out of the primary agent workflow.
- Reusing existing ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude web accounts for interactive website features outside an API workflow.

`ask-bridge` does not guarantee that provider output is correct, and it should not replace local tests, official documentation checks, or human review. Its role is to reduce the operational cost of exploratory AI work and let the primary Coding Agent obtain external AI assistance with less friction.

Unlike typical API clients, `ask-bridge` operates inside a real Chrome browser with a **persistent user profile**. This means:
- You log in manually **once** (`ask-bridge login`).
- You can solve CAPTCHAs, pass provider-side browser checks, and access the selected provider's web features like a normal user.
- Your session cookies, login state, and chat history are saved persistently.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🦀 100% Rust Core**: Extremely fast, lightweight, and compile-once, run-anywhere binary.
- **Multi-provider support**: Choose ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or experimental Microsoft 365 Copilot with `--provider chatgpt|gemini|claude|m365`.
- **Global provider config**: Set the default provider in `~/.config/ask-bridge/config.json`; CLI `--provider` overrides the config file.
- **🌐 Real Browser Automation**: Directly interacts with Chrome on port `9223` (isolated debug profile).
- **🔒 Persistent Login**: Uses a dedicated local profile directory (`~/.config/ask-bridge/chrome-profile`) so you never lose your login state.
- **Response Output**: Prints the selected provider's response back to your terminal.
- **🌀 TUI Thinking Animation**: Displays a rotating spinner while waiting for the provider to reply, then clears it once output starts.
- **🧠 Intelligent Tab Management**: Reuses existing provider tabs if open, focuses them, or opens new ones, avoiding tab clutter.
- **🖥️ Pipe & Stdin Support**: Supports piping prompts via `stdin` (e.g. `cat report.txt | ask-bridge "summarize this"`).
- **📎 Image & File Attachments**: Upload attachments with `--image`/`--file`; Windows experimental M365 V2 supports PNG/JPEG and PDF/DOCX/TXT.
- **🔀 Model and Reasoning Selection**: Use `--model`/`--reasoning` for provider options; M365 V2 is enabled only on Windows.
- **Resume Conversations**: ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude support URLs and IDs; Windows experimental M365 V2 supports full conversation URLs only.
- **Response Timeout**: Use `--timeout <seconds>` to control how long to wait for a provider response, defaulting to `300` seconds.
- **🔍 Quiet by Default & Verbose Mode**: Quiet and clean output by default (displaying only the generated response), with an optional `--verbose` flag to display full browser state logs if needed.
- **Version Info**: Use `-v` or `--version` to print the current version number.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run this tool, you need:

1. **Node.js 20.19.0 LTS or newer LTS**, with both `node` and `npx` available in the current shell's `PATH`. `ask-bridge` starts `chrome-devtools-mcp@latest` through `npx`; older Node.js versions, such as `v20.11.0`, can cause the MCP server to exit during `initialize`.
2. **Google Chrome** installed (normally located at `/Applications/Google Chrome.app` on macOS). `make install` installs it with Homebrew when it is missing and Homebrew is available.

Check the Node.js version visible to your current shell:

```bash
node -v
npx -v
```

| Platform | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | Install a Node.js LTS release with Homebrew or nvm. If you use nvm, make sure the same shell that runs `ask-bridge` has loaded nvm and that `node -v` reports `v20.19.0` or newer. Chrome is detected at `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome` by default. |
| Windows | Install a Node.js LTS release with the official installer, winget, or nvm-windows. Reopen PowerShell after installation, then verify that `node -v` and `npx -v` work. Chrome is detected from the standard `Program Files`, `Program Files (x86)`, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%` install paths. |
| Linux | Distribution package repositories may provide an older Node.js version. Prefer NodeSource, nvm, or an official Node.js LTS source. Install Google Chrome Stable and make sure `google-chrome` or `google-chrome-stable` is available in `PATH`; Snap, Flatpak, or Chromium installs may not match the default detection logic. |

You do **not** need a global `mcp-cli` executable. The Rust binary uses `mcp-cli` as a Cargo dependency from `https://github.com/doggy8088/mcp-cli`.

## 🚀 Installation & Build

### 1. Quick Installation (Recommended)

If you only want to use the pre-compiled Release version (without installing the Rust toolchain), you can run one of the following one-liner installation scripts. They will automatically verify the Node.js requirement, download the appropriate binary for your system architecture, and place it in your `~/.local/bin/` folder.

#### macOS / Linux
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doggy8088/ask-bridge/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows
Open PowerShell (recommended to Run as Administrator) and run:
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doggy8088/ask-bridge/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the installation path (`~/.local/bin` for macOS/Linux, and `$HOME\.local\bin` for Windows) is added to your system's `PATH` environment variable.
> The formal CLI command is `ask-bridge`; the installer also provides `ask` as a backward-compatible alias. The examples below use `ask-bridge`.
> The Windows installer verifies that the download is a PE executable, runs a
> `--version` smoke test, and puts the official install directory first in User
> PATH. Run `where.exe ask-bridge` and confirm that the first expanded path ends
> with `\.local\bin\ask-bridge.exe`.

### 2. Build & Install from Source (For Developers)

Clone or navigate to the project directory and build/install with Make:

```bash
make install
```

This verifies the Node.js environment, installs the required Chrome browser if needed, builds the optimized binary, links the formal command to `~/.local/bin/ask-bridge`, and also creates the `ask` alias.

### 3. Build Only

If you only want to build without installing:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be located at `target/release/ask-bridge`.

### 4. Install the Agent Skill

This repository provides an `ask-bridge` Agent Skill so Skills-compatible Coding Agents can use `ask-bridge` to delegate exploratory research, summarization, document analysis, or option comparison tasks to the ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude websites.

Install it with `npx skills`; you do not need to copy the `skills/` directory manually:

```bash
npx skills add doggy8088/ask-bridge --skill ask-bridge
```

To install it globally for Codex, specify the agent and global scope:

```bash
npx skills add doggy8088/ask-bridge --skill ask-bridge --agent codex --global
```

---

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. First Time Setup: Login to a provider

Before sending prompts, you need to log in to the selected provider. ChatGPT is the default when no global provider is configured:

```bash
ask-bridge login
```

For Gemini, Claude, or Microsoft 365 Copilot:

```bash
ask-bridge --provider gemini login
ask-bridge --provider claude login
ask-bridge --provider m365 login
```

- This will automatically launch Google Chrome with a dedicated, persistent debug profile.
- Log in manually to the selected provider page, such as `https://chatgpt.com/`, `https://gemini.google.com/app`, `https://claude.ai/new`, or `https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat`.
- The tool now checks login status every second automatically, so you can stay on the browser and it will return immediately after login is detected.
- If login is not detected within `--timeout` seconds (default: 300), it will warn you to verify the result and retry.

M365 login always uses a visible Chrome window so you can complete Microsoft Entra, MFA, or Conditional Access checks. The tool never attempts to bypass organization policy.

#### Global Provider Config

To use Gemini, Claude, or M365 by default when `--provider` is not specified:

```bash
ask-bridge config --provider gemini
ask-bridge config --provider claude
ask-bridge config --provider m365
```

To switch the default back to ChatGPT:

```bash
ask-bridge config --provider chatgpt
```

You can check the current setting with:

```bash
ask-bridge config
```

`--provider` has higher priority than the global config file, so this command temporarily uses ChatGPT:

```bash
ask-bridge --provider chatgpt "Summarize this text."
```

### 2. Send Prompts Directly

Simply pass your prompt as an argument:

```bash
ask-bridge "What is the difference between a struct and a tuple in Rust?"
ask-bridge --provider gemini "What is the difference between a struct and a tuple in Rust?"
ask-bridge --provider claude "What is the difference between a struct and a tuple in Rust?"
ask-bridge --provider m365 "What is the difference between a struct and a tuple in Rust?"
```

- Chrome will open or focus on your selected provider tab.
- The prompt will be typed out and submitted.
- The selected provider's response will be printed in your terminal.

#### Experimental Microsoft 365 Copilot support

The first M365 release supports text prompts, text or Markdown responses, `login`, `open`, `get`, `--new`, `--output`, and `--timeout`. The CLI prints the current page as a Thread Link after a query, but does not yet promise that the URL can be used for CLI session resume.

**M365 V2 is Windows-only experimental.** Windows enables:

- Full conversation URLs through `--session-url` or URL-form `--session`; raw `--session-id` remains unsupported.
- Models `GPT 5.6`, `GPT 5.5`, `Sonnet`, and `Opus`.
- Reasoning `auto`/`自動`, `quick`/`快速回應`, and `think-deeper`/`深度思考`.
- PDF, DOCX, and TXT through `--file`.
- PNG and JPEG through `--image`.
- Explicit latest-assistant generated-image download through `--image-output`.

macOS and Linux retain M365 text-only behavior; V2 flags fail before Chrome starts with a Windows-only experimental error. DLP/policy blocking has not been validated in a dedicated tenant and is an acknowledged limitation rather than a Windows release gate. If policy blocks an operation, the tool stops without attempting a bypass.

### 3. Open a Brand New Session (`--new`)

By default, `ask-bridge` will reuse any existing open tab for the selected provider to avoid cluttering your browser with too many tabs.

If you want to start a **completely fresh conversation session** (equivalent to clicking "New Chat" in the sidebar), use the `--new` flag:

```bash
ask-bridge "誰是保哥？" --new
```

- This will open a **brand new selected-provider tab**.
- All provider and non-provider tabs that existed before the command will be preserved.
- If the new tab cannot be identified unambiguously, the command stops instead of
  reusing or closing an existing tab.

### 4. Resume an Existing Conversation

Pass either a provider conversation ID or a full conversation URL to continue its
existing web context:

```bash
ask-bridge --provider chatgpt --session-id "conversation-uuid" "Continue the previous plan."
ask-bridge --session-url "https://chatgpt.com/c/conversation-uuid" "Produce the next steps."
ask-bridge --provider gemini --session "conversation-id" "Continue the analysis."
```

`--session`, `--session-id`, and `--session-url` are separate, mutually exclusive
options. `--session` detects a full URL versus an ID, `--session-id` accepts only
a raw ID, and `--session-url` accepts only a full HTTPS conversation URL. An ID
uses the selected or configured provider to build the conversation URL. A full
URL identifies its provider automatically. The command stops before opening
Chrome when an explicitly selected provider conflicts with the URL, the URL does
not belong to a supported provider, or `--new` is also supplied. Existing tabs
are preserved.

M365 V2 on Windows is URL-only; raw `--session-id` is unsupported:

```powershell
ask-bridge --provider m365 --session-url "https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/conversation/<id>" "Continue this conversation."
```

M365 session V2 flags remain unavailable on macOS and Linux.

### 5. Headless Mode (Default: True)

By default, standard queries run Chrome in **headless mode** (`--headless=true`) so that the browser operates silently in the background without stealing your focus or popping up windows.

If you want to watch Chrome work in real-time or need to manually check what's happening on the page, you can run in **headful mode** by setting `--headless=false`:

```bash
ask-bridge "誰是保哥？" --headless=false
```

*Note: `ask-bridge login` always overrides the default and runs in **headful mode** so you can interact with the UI. For other subcommands, pass `--headless=false` when you want a visible browser.*

### 6. Verbose Mode (`--verbose`)

By default, `ask-bridge` runs in a **quiet, clean mode** that hides all background browser-control logs (such as "Checking open Chrome tabs...", "Typing prompt...", etc.) and only displays the final markdown answer. However, it still plays an animated rotating spinner in your terminal while waiting for the provider to generate a response.

If you want to see detailed step-by-step status logs of what `ask-bridge` is doing behind the scenes, add the `--verbose` flag:

```bash
ask-bridge "誰是保哥？" --verbose
```

This will print every stage of the browser automation:
- Checking open Chrome tabs...
- Focusing input field...
- Typing your prompt...
- Submitting...
- Waiting for provider response...

### 7. Response Timeout (`--timeout`)

The default wait time is 300 seconds. If a provider takes longer, increase (or decrease) the timeout:

```bash
ask-bridge "Please summarize this report" --timeout 600
```

You can also set a shorter timeout:

```bash
ask-bridge "Short answer" --timeout 60
```

If the response does not complete within the configured seconds, `ask-bridge` will stop waiting and print a timeout warning.

### 8. Version Info

Use `-v` or `--version` to print the current version number:

```bash
ask-bridge -v
```

### 9. Piping & Stdin Support

You can pipe text or files directly into `ask-bridge`:

```bash
echo "Explain quantum computing in one sentence" | ask-bridge
```

When you also pass a prompt argument, `ask-bridge` uses the prompt first and then appends stdin content after two newlines:

```bash
cat /Users/will/.copilot/session-state/46cc0f1c-79fd-4622-9548-a0b7fa3794be/research/does-cursor-support-byok.md | ask-bridge 'What is this?'
```

Or read files:

```bash
cat src/main.rs | ask-bridge "Are there any memory leaks in this Rust code?"
```

### 10. Attaching Images or Files

Instead of piping file contents into the prompt, you can upload local files as attachments directly to the selected provider.

#### Attach images

Use `--image` (repeatable) to attach one or more local images. ChatGPT and Claude retain their current support; Windows experimental M365 V2 supports PNG and JPEG. Gemini still rejects `--image`.

```bash
ask-bridge "Describe this image." --image screenshot.png
ask-bridge "Compare these two images." --image v1.png --image v2.png
ask-bridge --provider claude "Describe this image." --image screenshot.png
ask-bridge --provider m365 --new "Describe this image." --image screenshot.png
```

Supported formats include PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, BMP, and more.

#### Attach documents

Use `--file` (repeatable) to attach documents. ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude retain their existing formats; Windows experimental M365 V2 supports only PDF, DOCX, and TXT.

```bash
ask-bridge "Summarize this PDF." --file report.pdf
ask-bridge "How many rows are in this CSV?" --file data.csv
ask-bridge "Check this code for issues." --file src/main.rs
ask-bridge --provider m365 --new "Summarize this document." --file report.pdf
```

You can attach images and documents at the same time:

```bash
ask-bridge "Compare this design image against the spec document and list inconsistencies." --image design.png --file spec.docx
```

### 11. Switch Models and Reasoning

Use `--model` to switch the provider model before the prompt is sent. Use `--reasoning` separately for provider-specific reasoning modes. ChatGPT accepts both in one invocation; Gemini Extended Thinking is compatible only with Pro models.

```bash
ask-bridge "Prove this math problem." --model "GPT-5.6 Sol" --reasoning high
ask-bridge "Quickly translate this." --reasoning instant
ask-bridge --provider gemini "Introduce Rust in a few sentences." --model "3.6 Flash"
ask-bridge --provider gemini "Prove this math problem." --model "3.1 Pro" --reasoning extended
ask-bridge --provider claude "Introduce Rust in a few sentences." --model Sonnet
ask-bridge --provider m365 --new "Answer quickly." --reasoning quick
ask-bridge --provider m365 --new "Use the selected model." --model "GPT 5.5"
```

Argument rules:

- **ChatGPT**: `--reasoning` accepts `auto`, `instant`, `medium`, and `high`, plus the corresponding aliases `智慧`, `即時`, `中`, `中等`, and `高`.
- **Gemini**: `--reasoning extended` selects Extended Thinking. Omit `--model` or combine it with an available Pro model.
- **Claude**: `--reasoning` is unsupported. Existing Sonnet, Opus, and Haiku `--model` selection is unchanged.
- **Microsoft 365 Copilot (Windows-only experimental)**: reasoning supports `auto`/`自動`, `quick`/`快速回應`, and `think-deeper`/`深度思考`; models support `GPT 5.6`, `GPT 5.5`, `Sonnet`, and `Opus`. They share one UI control and cannot be combined in one invocation. Use `--new` when an existing conversation has no visible picker.

On Windows, M365 generated-image download runs only when `--image-output` is explicitly supplied; otherwise it does not scan or persist enterprise images.

```powershell
ask-bridge --provider m365 --image-output .\generated get "https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/conversation/<id>"
```

Model matching uses only each menu item's primary label and ignores subtitles and badges. It remains case- and punctuation-insensitive. The tool never maps an obsolete model version to a different version. If the primary label is unavailable, the error lists the provider options currently found and aborts before sending the prompt.

Legacy forms such as `--model 高` and Gemini `--model 延伸思考` remain temporarily supported with a deprecation warning. Use `--reasoning` instead.

### 12. Just Open a Provider

To quickly launch the browser and open the selected provider without sending any query:

```bash
ask-bridge open
ask-bridge --provider gemini open
ask-bridge --provider claude open
ask-bridge --provider m365 open
```

### 13. Close the Browser Instance

To close the Chrome debug profile instance managed by `ask-bridge`:

```bash
ask-bridge close
```

`close` only shuts down the `ask-bridge` Chrome instance that uses `~/.config/ask-bridge/chrome-profile` and listens on debug port `9223`. If that port is occupied by a non-`ask-bridge` Chrome process, it reports an error instead of closing it.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (Under the Hood)

1. **Browser Initialization**: `ask-bridge` checks if Chrome is listening on debugging port `9223`. If not, it spawns Google Chrome as a background process with a custom profile directory (`~/.config/ask-bridge/chrome-profile`).
2. **MCP Bridge Config**: On startup, it automatically writes a custom `mcp_servers.json` to `~/.config/ask-bridge/mcp_servers.json`, configuring the Chrome DevTools MCP server by default with `chrome-devtools-mcp@latest` and `--browser-url=http://127.0.0.1:9223`.
3. **Client Call**: `ask-bridge` calls the embedded `doggy8088/mcp-cli` Rust library dependency, invoking `list_pages`, `select_page`, `type_text`, and `evaluate_script` tools to automate the DOM without relying on an external `mcp-cli` executable.
4. **State Polling**: During generation, a lightweight JavaScript engine checks the provider's send/stop button states and extracts response element inner-text for terminal output.
